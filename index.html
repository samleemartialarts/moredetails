        </nav>
        <p>The Academy is best described as a continuation of the 
        teaching and practice of Grandmaster Sam Lee, with a mission to continue the transmission 
        of the knowledge, skill and compassion handed-down by him whilst preserving the highest respect 
        he held for the traditional methods.</p>

        <p> Like the symbol of Ireland and St. Patrick - the shamrock <span class="shamrock">☘️</span>- Sifu Lee's practice was a triad of
        Tai Chi, Qi Gong and Choy Lay Fut (Kung-fu).</p>

        <p>Primarily the focus is on people and community but also the self by way of
        self-cultivation, strengthening the body, health improvement and learning 
        martial arts. A core focus is the preservation of the quality of practice of these skills as 
        correctness of the techniques yield better results.</p>

        <p>Practice and teaching also focuses on the self, internal energy, and health through learning classical open-hand and 
        weapons forms. Underpinning the practice is the desire to promote the style and culture of these martial arts.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="tai-chi">Wu Style Tai Chi</h3>

        <p>Following from Sifu Lee's teaching and practice his students now specializing in the traditional methods 
        and old long-forms of the Wu style Tai Chi Chuan, 
        It is a very traditional style characterised by the strong spirit it generates.
        Wu tai chi promotes natural energy flow, physical and mental balances. 
        Wu Tai Chi builds up the body muscle while the training is aimed at relaxation and concentrates on body coordination, that is achieved through improved blood circulation and energy flow.</p>

        <p>Wu Tai Chi is easy to learn.  It is very calming and restorative to the body.  It is excellent for dealing with stress, increasing energy and helps to detoxify the body through the gentle massage of the kidneys and other vital organs.  Regular practice leads to an increased sense of well-being and a clear, healthy complexion.  It is extremely useful in rehabilitation as the movements are slow, gentle and open up the joints, bringing increased blood flow, Qi and nutrients to all parts of the body.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="qi-gong">Qi Gong</h3>

        <p>Through Qi Gong we start to become aware of the relationship between our consciousness (the self) and the Qi that gives us physical form and animates us.
        We build up an internal awareness and sensitivity that allows us to tune into our body and internal energy.
        In Sifu Lee's Qi Gong the very first postural alignment is designed to open a connection to spirit by “raising our spirit”. This informs all subsequent actions. Therefore rather than willing energy to move we intend it to move through a harmonious relationship with our spiritual self.</p>

        <p><strong>You can learn how to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tune up your Qi</li>
            <li>Function your Qi</li>
            <li>Move your Qi</li>
            <li>Build up your energy system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With dedicated practice over time: a practitioner can come to see that energy follows intent. Developing the intent is key in this. 
        It is used for self-cultivation, self-healing the body and well-being.</p>

        <p>An example of a core practice one could expect to learn would be the Eight Brocade Qi Gong, among others.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="kung-fu">Choy Lay Fut</h3>

        <p>Sifu Lee was a student of the late Grand-master Lee Koon-Hung, 5th generation Choy Lay Fut Kung Fu.
        The first ever Hong Sing Koon was founded in 1839.
        There are many branches of Hong Sing Choy Lay Fut Kung-Fu.</p>

        <p>Choy Lay Fut came about in a time of political up-heaval and revolution and was developed to fight
        multiple opponents at one time. It combines nimble footwork with devastating sweeping strikes.
        It is recognised for it's signature 'Sau Choy' and 'Chop Choy' strikes.
        The practice trains a combination of hardness and softness taking advantage of angled strikes and sweeping motions.</p>
